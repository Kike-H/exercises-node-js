# Exercise 1

Write a program to calculate the total of a bill of sale after a discount.
Accept the note amount and the discount percentage as input. Validate the note
before calculating the discount. Use a timer to calculate the discount after
of a delay, since the discount must be calculated only after the
note validation.
